Steps:
Load AWR Reports Data:
Parse the AWR reports and load the relevant data into Pandas DataFrames. 

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the data. Handle missing values, convert data types if necessary.

Feature Selection:
Identify the key performance metrics we want to analyze for anomaly detection. 

Data Visualization:
Plot time series graphs to visualize the trends and patterns in the selected metrics. This can help us to identify any unusual spikes or dips in the data.

Statistical Analysis:
Calculate statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles for each metric. Deviations from the expected values can be indicative of anomalies.

Anomaly Detection Algorithms:

Visualize Anomalies:
Plot the detected anomalies on the time series graphs. This visualization can help you understand when anomalies occurred and which metrics were affected.

Thresholds and Alerts:
Set thresholds for each metric, and trigger alerts when values exceed or fall below these thresholds. This can help automate the anomaly detection process.
